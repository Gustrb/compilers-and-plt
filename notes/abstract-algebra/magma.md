# Magma (Abstract Algebra)

In *abstract algebra* a magma is a super basic algebraic structure. It has the following structure:
1. A set S
2. A binary operation in the set S (preserving closure)

It imposes no other structure, and is just a level of abstraction on top of sets and binary operations. Therefore,
most algebraic structures can be thought as Magmas + structure.

Therefore, the vast majority of examples of Magmas are also examples of other algebraic structures, one interesting example of something
that is just a magma is the following:

## Magma Example 

Let X be the set of finite planar binary trees. Given two trees a and b we can form the a . b through the union of the two tress by adding a new root.

And it will return a tree such as this one:

This is, by definition a binary operation, and it is not associative (just draw the result to see). Since that every possible composition generates a larger tree, we can assert that there is no identity element, thus this is a Magma and only that.
